#beatmaps = creates a string from all the directories found in the folder to be processed with regex.
#pattern = specifies regex to find numbers until first space; '1 Kenji Ninuma - DISCOâ˜…PRINCE' will return '1 ' (space included).
#processed = removes all spaces of the form ' ' in the regex find. the regex find all function has a 'pattern to match', 'string of beatmap directories', 
#'flag to indicate that they are separated with a \n line break character'. if not provided, the regex will fail to match more than 1.
#clipboard = creates a new string of the filtered results in the form of '1,1110,556,87..' and finally it copies it to the clipboard.
